/* Fieldset styling is a bit different compared to the default form styling.
This is because of a couple of styling restrictions and issues concerning fieldsets and it's children.
- Fieldsets can't use flexbox 
- When elements within the fieldset use flexbox, unwanted white-space appears at the bottom of the fieldset.
The amount of whitespace depends on the length of the fieldset before flex positioning took place. And will not be removed after. 

The usage of fieldsets is recommended because it is the semantically correct element to use for form grouping.
As well as it improves the experience for users who are using a screenreader to navigate the form. 

To prevent these issues to cause unexpected behaviour the fieldset and it's children within this set do no use flexbox for their positioning.
But the alternative styling as you can see below.
